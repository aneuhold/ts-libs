/**
 * When thinking about the logic of tasks, the following thoughts come to mind:
 *
 * What would you expect a task manager to do in the case that you have a task
 * with a bunch of subtasks, and you share that single task with another person?
 *
 * - Should the subtasks be automatically shared as well no matter what? (Would make behavior simpler for the user)
 * - Should there instead be an option to share the subtasks automatically?
 * - In the case that the other user adds a subtask to the original task you shared, would you expect to see that subtask?
 * - If there is an option to not share the subtasks automatically, what happens when the other user adds a subtask to the one you shared?
 *
 * Because of the complexity for the user in not automatically sharing subtasks,
 * it seems better to always automatically share subtasks. In a theoretical sense,
 * sharing a task with someone seems to imply the shared ownership of completing
 * the overall task, including all the subtasks.
 *
 * Recurring Tasks:
 *
 * - The user sets a task as recurring with a frequency? Only that task is marked, because when the recurrence comes up, the frontend will update that task and all sub tasks.
 * - The date + time for the recurrence happens? If the users browser is open, the frontend will trigger the update ideally. This needs to be checked if this can be done in a performant way.

   * - A user that has been shared a task adds a subtask? The subtask gets the same owner as the parent shared task.
   * - A shared task with subtasks is unshared? The frontend will need to make the updates and send them to the backend.
   * - A user removes a collaborator and they have shared tasks with that
